```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
```

## get attitude data


```{r }
tude <- attitude

```
## Take a look

```{r}
boxplot(tude)
```

## Is there a difference between complaints and privileges


```{r}
t.test(tude$privileges,tude$learning)
```
##Using bootstrp

```{r }
source("bootstrp.R")
result <- bootstrp(tude$privileges,tude$learning,1000)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Which of the 7 different attitudes are similiar with respect to their means??
